# Interview Questions and Answers

## Introduction
Our mobile application aims to help people order food online from different kinds of merchants. We found that so many students and workers are busy with their work and have no time to eat food. Though they are free to have meals, they have no idea about what to eat. This app can provide nice food choices and fast delivery for them. They only need to choose food they like and wait so that they can enjoy their food as soon as possible.

## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments:
I think the target users of our software are students and staff. They often take up too much time for study and work, and our software can provide them with more food choices. We see that some restaurants will provide take-out services, and our software can integrate their services well and provide them to customers in a faster way. I think our products exist as an intermediary, and our main task is to provide better connections between consumers and restaurants.
