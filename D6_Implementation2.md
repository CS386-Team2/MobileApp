# Implementation 2( *Deliverable-06* )

## 1. Introduction
E-Kitchen is a take-away app that allows staff and students who are pressed for time to have a great meal without going to the restaurant. We support several languages that make sure both foreigners and locals are well served. Users can order their meal at the restaurant opening time and got the meal in the place they gave.

## 3. Demo

## 4. Code quality 
 
## 5. Lessons learned  
* Programming = coding, testing and debugging. Each of them is important when developing a software. But first of all, we need to write code in a good style so that it is easy for us to test and debug the code we are implementing.
* Code in good quality makes the sofeware more powerful and useful. We have to show beautiful and clean code to make the code have fewer bugs. Also, doing this can make it easy to maintain the software and improve team productivity.
* users are the most important part in out software development. Therefore, it's our responsibility to make the software friendly to our users including user interface, functions and use experiences.
* If we continue to develop the sofeware, we need to make user interface more beautiful. It maybe difficult for us to succeed in doing this but we will do our best to try it. Moreover, we need to improve our funtions since it looks a bit simple and crude now.
