# D4 Implementation 1

## Introduction 
E-Kitchen is a take-away app that allows staff and students who are pressed for time to have a great meal without going out for meal, We support several languages that make sure both foreigners and locals are well served. Users can order their meal at the restaurant opening time and got the meal just in front of where they are. It's very convenient.

## Implementation Requirements 
In this release, we have completed user registration and login. In addition, we also added some restaurant information, including the restaurantâ€™s pictures, address and description. After completing these parts, the user can now register an account and log in. Users can also see information about some restaurants. The use cases we implemented include registering an account, login in to an account, and List Restaurant Information.
* Hao Liu: Register Feature
* Zhibang Qin: LogIn Feature
* Yunsong Wang: Order System Feature
* Kehan Cao: Revise all the source code

## Adopted Technologies
In our project, we are trying to use the android studio to build the app. We are using JAVA to design the outlook and framework of our project. Cause JAVA is an object-oriented programming language for cross-platform applications, and JAVA is stable and widely used.


## Learning / Training 
We have systematically studied simple Java programming before, for the Java technologies needed in our project, we intend to take the approach of searching the Web and referring to sample programs.

## Deployment
We plan for continual deployment once we get our application farther along. We would have update constantly and consistently pushing out updates and patches for the best experience for our users.
* AWS is under audit by its system.

## Look and Feel
The look and feel we are trying to go with is simple and easy-to-use. We want the app to be easy to navigate and figure out. The tabs are very clearly labeled and they all do and include exactly what they say. 


## Lessons Learned
The lesson I learned is that no one else has been coding and it is getting difficult to try to get in contact with out group to make sure they are working.
